    "\n",
    "1. **Content Validation**: Send any text input or output to the ApplyGuardrail API to have it evaluated against your defined topic avoidance rules, content filters, PII detectors, and word blocklists. You can evaluate user inputs and FM generated outputs independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flexible Deployment**: Integrate the Guardrails API anywhere in your application flow to validate data before processing or serving results to users. E.g. For a RAG application, you can now evaluate the user input prior to performing the retrieval instead of waiting until the final response generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decoupled from Foundation Models**: ApplyGuardrail is decoupled from foundational models. You can now use Guardrails without invoking Foundation Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the assessment results to design the experience on your generative AI application. Let's now walk through a code-sample"

    "1. `generate_text`: Calls our Language Model via a SageMaker endpoint to generate text based on the input.\n",

    "1. It first checks the input prompt using `analyze_prompt`.\n",
    "2. If the input passes the guardrail, it generates text using `generate_text`.\n",

It's designed to easily integrate with larger applications while providing flexibility for error handling and customization based on guardrail results."
