    "## Introduction to RAFT\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT) aims to improve the performance of large language models on domain-specific open-book question answering tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/x1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "RAFT trains the language model to ignore \"distractor\" documents that do not contain relevant information to answer the given question, and instead focus on extracting the answer from the \"golden\" relevant documents. It also encourages the model to generate chain-of-thought style responses that cite relevant quotes from the documents, which improves the model's reasoning abilities. Experiments show that RAFT consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation approaches across several specialized domains like medical literature, coding APIs, and multi-hop reasoning.\n",

    "In this series of notebooks you will learn how to build a RAFT dataset based on the PubMedQA dataset, then train a new generation model in a SageMaker Managed Training Job, then host the fine-tuned model on SageMaker hosting or Bedrock via Custom Model Import. After hosting the model, you will run some quick evaluations to quantify the improvement on hold out data."

The study included 19 patients with episodes of acute rejection (ARE) within the first year after transplantation. All patients had negative crossmatch tests before transplantation. Patients underwent biopsy for histologic and C4d examinations. All patients were monitored for donor-specific HLA alloantibodies during the first posttransplant year. Complement-dependent cytotoxic crossmatches were performed with donor lymphocytes. In eight patients, the crossmatch test results changed to positive during ARE. In all biopsies except one with cortical infarction, we observed C4d staining (group 1). The biopsies of four patients showed histologic changes of AMR, and all of their grafts were lost. In one patient, cellular and vascular rejection (Banff II) were present; in two, Banff I; and in one, borderline lesions.
